This project implements a simple Tic Tac Toe game using socket programming in Python. It consists of three main files:

1. `client.py`: This file contains the client-side code for the Tic Tac Toe game. It connects to the server and interacts with it to play the game.

2. `server.py`: This file contains the server-side code for the Tic Tac Toe game. It handles incoming connections from clients, manages game sessions, and ensures fair gameplay.

3. `tictactoe.py`: This file contains the core logic for the Tic Tac Toe game. It defines the game board, checks for win conditions, and handles player moves.
To play the Tic Tac Toe game, follow these steps:

1. Run the `server.py` file to start the server.
2. Run the `client.py` file to start the client.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. Players take turns making moves by selecting positions on the Tic Tac Toe board.
4. The game continues until one player wins, or the board is filled (resulting in a draw).
